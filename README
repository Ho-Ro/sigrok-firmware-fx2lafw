fx2lafw
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fx2lafw is a free/libre/open-source firmware for logic analyzers based on
the Cypress EZ-USB FX2(LP) chip.

It is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL (version 2 or later), and uses
additional helper code (fx2lib), licensed under the GNU LGPL (version 2.1
or later).


Requirements
------------

 - In order to build fx2lafw you need the 'sdcc' compiler.
   On Debian you can install it via:

     $ apt-get install sdcc

 - You need libsigrok >= 0.1.1 in order to make use of fx2lafw. Earlier
   versions didn't have support for FX2 devices using this firmware.


Building
--------

  $ git clone git://sigrok.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/sigrok/fx2lafw
  $ cd fx2lafw
  $ make


Installation
------------

  $ sudo make install

The generated *.fw files are installed into /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware.

You can override the install location like this:

  $ sudo make install DESTDIR=/usr/share/sigrok-firmware


fx2lib
------

The fx2lafw code uses a (slightly modified) "fx2lib" helper library.

It was imported into fx2lafw from

  git://github.com/ubixum/fx2lib.git

as of Feb 12, 2012 (git hash "416c104cbd").

The following files/directories were removed, as they're not needed
for our purposes: CHANGELOG, COPYING*, docs/, examples/, fw/, and utils/.
