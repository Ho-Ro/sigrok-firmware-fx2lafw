fx2lafw
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fx2lafw is a free/libre/open-source firmware for logic analyzers based on
the Cypress EZ-USB FX2(LP) chip.

It is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL (version 2 or later), and uses
additional helper code (fx2lib), licensed under the GNU LGPL (version 2.1
or later).


Requirements
------------

 - In order to build fx2lafw you need the 'sdcc' compiler.
   On Debian you can install it via:

     $ apt-get install sdcc

 - You need libsigrok >= 0.1.1 in order to make use of fx2lafw. Earlier
   versions didn't have support for FX2 devices using this firmware.


Building
--------

  $ git clone git://sigrok.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/sigrok/fx2lafw
  $ cd fx2lafw
  $ make


Usage
-----

Copy the generated *.fw file for your device (e.g. fx2lafw-saleae-logic.fw)
into the $prefix/share/sigrok-firmware directory (create it, if needed).

Replace $prefix with the install prefix of sigrok, e.g. /usr or /usr/local.

Example (assuming /usr/local as $prefix):

  $ sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware

  $ sudo cp hw/saleae-logic/build/fx2lafw-saleae-logic.fw \
            /usr/local/share/sigrok-firmware

The sigrok frontends (command-line or GUI) will automatically search for
firmware files there and automatically use/upload them.


fx2lib
------

The fx2lafw code uses a (slightly modified) "fx2lib" helper library.

It was imported into fx2lafw from

  git://github.com/ubixum/fx2lib.git

as of Feb 12, 2012 (git hash "416c104cbd").

The following files/directories were removed, as they're not needed
for our purposes: CHANGELOG, COPYING*, docs/, examples/, fw/, and utils/.
